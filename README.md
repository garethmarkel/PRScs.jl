# PRS-CS

**PRS-CS** is a Python based command line tool that infers posterior SNP effect sizes under continuous shrinkage (CS) priors
using GWAS summary statistics and an external LD reference panel. Details of the method are described in the article:

T Ge, CY Chen, Y Ni, YCA Feng, JW Smoller. Polygenic Prediction via Bayesian Regression and Continuous Shrinkage Priors. *Nature Communications*, 10:1776, 2019.

**PRScs.jl** is the Julia implementation of the above.
